# nueral_net_or_function

The program is the implementation of the nueral net or function when two inputs are given. Perceptron learning algorithm is used here.Initially the weights are associated with each of 
the input and weights are varied based on the variations in the actual and the prediced outcome.Language used for coding the program is c++.

There are 3 files in the repositary one consists of the code of the program, the other two are the text files which consists of the input which is given to the program and the output 
which is obtained from the program.
